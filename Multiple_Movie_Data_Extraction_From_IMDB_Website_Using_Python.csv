It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/,9.3,"['Tim Robbins', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Bob Gunton']",['Frank Darabont']

This is a direct continuation of that story.

The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can&apos;t possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what&apos;s basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.

Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) &quot;in the role&quot; of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn&apos;t so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.

After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone&apos;s mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the &quot;inside&quot; was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn&apos;t convey Michael&apos;s underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.

During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren&apos;t well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.

Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended &quot;flashback&quot; segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that&apos;s a bit of my bias creeping in, as I&apos;m a huge De Niro fan.

But let&apos;s talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we&apos;re toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.

There&apos;s also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I&apos;d now call &quot;J.K. Rowling Syndrome&quot;. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.

The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.

I&apos;ve barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn&apos;t a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.

The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can&apos;t remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.

Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film&apos;s importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/,9.0,"['Al Pacino', 'Robert De Niro', 'Robert Duvall']",['Francis Ford Coppola']
254,12 Angry Men (1957) - IMDb,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE4NzdmOTYtYjc5Yi00YzBiLWEzNDEtNTgxZGQ2MWVkN2NiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,The jury in a New York City murder trial is frustrated by a single member whose skeptical caution forces them to more carefully consider the evidence before jumping to a hasty verdict.,2002-09-18,1H36M,"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said &quot;Its the bees&apos; knees&quot;. The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.

The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.

The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda&apos;s character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.

On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.

I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.

But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.

I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider&apos;s advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.

The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I&apos;d pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it&apos;s amazing that &quot;Fellowship&quot; was filmed in one country.

Now to the characters.  All I can say is, &quot;Wow.&quot;  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I&apos;d created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn&apos;t want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood&apos;s pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (&quot;Rudy&quot; forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien&apos;s telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen&apos;s character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in &quot;The Return of the King&quot; to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can&apos;t help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer&apos;s very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas&apos;s bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan&apos;s showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.

Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron&apos;s mouth water.  Knowing that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/,8.9,"['Elijah Wood', 'Ian McKellen', 'Orlando Bloom']",['Peter Jackson']

Who hasn&apos;t heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60&apos;s pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre&apos;s. I mean, I would agree that most western&apos;s are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it&apos;s characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let&apos;s give it up for Sergio!

The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It&apos;s a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.

As stated, the road to the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers&apos; biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it&apos;s simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. It&apos;s difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm&apos;s Deep is simply unreal; it&apos;s unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.

As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It&apos;s much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great &apos;features&apos; of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a &apos;star,&apos; and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.

As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix&apos;s &apos;Bullet Time.&apos; The battle of Helm&apos;s Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli&apos;s visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers&apos; final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.

In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore&apos;s score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don&apos;t think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf&apos;s passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner&apos;s Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan&apos;s theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an &apos;A-list&apos; composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the &apos;A-list,&apos; right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.

If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm&apos;s Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/,8.8,"['Elijah Wood', 'Ian McKellen', 'Viggo Mortensen']",['Peter Jackson']

The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.

What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill&apos;s interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. 

Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. 

Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky&apos;s photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. 

ILM&apos;s visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. 

Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt&apos;s sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.

However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. 

Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/,8.7,"['Mark Hamill', 'Harrison Ford', 'Carrie Fisher']",['Irvin Kershner']

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the &quot;mental illness&quot; card to get out of prison time, thinking it&apos;ll be a piece of cake, but he&apos;s wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy&apos;s ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.

&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; (1975) is a film you&apos;ll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn&apos;t &apos;get&apos; a lot of the insights the film conveys.

The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their &quot;therapy&quot; is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer&apos;s expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be &quot;dealt with.&quot;

A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched &quot;isn&apos;t that bad&quot; or that &quot;she was only trying to do her job&quot;, etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film&apos;s brilliance: Ratched&apos;s malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she&apos;s authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.

The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway&apos;s portrayal of Joan Crawford in &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn&apos;t such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).

McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he&apos;s impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.

Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That&apos;s because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that &quot;appearances&quot; are not about inward reality and, worse, &quot;the letter kills.&quot;

Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you&apos;ll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren&apos;t any good people in such institutions, of course).

No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of &quot;Chief&quot; Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.

Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. 

Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he&apos;s a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That&apos;s a shame because he is a talented actor that isn&apos;t afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.

 The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher&apos;s talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. 

John Doe&apos;s plan really is twisted and I won&apos;t be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can&apos;t keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.

Bottom Line: If you haven&apos;t had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it.

George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He&apos;s got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he&apos;s got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the &quot;richest and meanest man in town&quot;, embodied in Lionel Barrymore.

It&apos;s a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn&apos;t hurt him.

Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.

But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he&apos;s given the story of George Bailey&apos;s life. And we see the kind of struggles he&apos;s had, the sacrifices he&apos;s made for the good of a whole lot of others. We&apos;ve also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. 

Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It&apos;s driven him to the brink of despair. That&apos;s why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It&apos;s something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.

But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven&apos;t contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It&apos;s a simple, but profound lesson.

What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It&apos;s an interesting point of speculation.

In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.

Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.

When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he&apos;s saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. 

And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It&apos;s A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/,8.6,"['James Stewart', 'Donna Reed', 'Lionel Barrymore']",['Frank Capra']

I don&apos;t see how anyone, especially a non-Japanese, could possibly absorb this movie in less than 2 or 3 viewings. I&apos;ve always been surprised at how each of the 7 samurai can make such an individual impression on you even if you can&apos;t understand Japanese. Although Toshiro Mifune is often considered the star, for me its Takashi Shimura who is firmly fixed at the center of the movie.  He is the guiding moral force from the moment of his appearance in the film and can capture the viewer&apos;s attention in a way similar to Alec Guinness.  Mifune&apos;s character can be annoying at first in his loutish behavior, but he gains stature throughout the film and eventually becomes a unifying force second only to Shimura.  Minoru Chiaki as the woodcutting samurai provides a subtle humor and the others look to him to boost their morale.  Daisuke Kato is another very familiar face to Japanese movie fans and provides an excellent foil to Shimura as his second in command.  Yoshio Inaba is very good as the samurai who is recruited by Shimura and quickly builds a strong rapport with him.  Seiji Miyaguchi as the &quot;expert&quot; warrior, dedicated to honing his skill as a swordsman is a very low key yet likeable character.  Ko Kimura as the young hero-worshipping samurai, as well as the love interest of the peasant girl, wishes to be a great samurai, but is easily distracted by a field of flowers or a pretty face.  The peasants in the village being defended by the samurai each have their own defining characteristics as well.

In addition to the wealth of interesting characters, we have a terrific action plot--the defending of the village from 40 marauding bandits by the small troop of samurai--, and a more subtle secondary plot involving the distrust of the samurai by the villagers due to the historical interaction of these two classes in feudal Japan.  All of these plot and character elements are woven together into an unforgettable epic, but, at least in my opinion, its not one that can be absorbed in a single sitting.  While it&apos;s similar in this sense to another of my favorite epics, Leone&apos;s Once Upon a Time in the West, it is more complex given the number of characters.

I can only say that your patience with this film will probably be well rewarded if you take the time to give it multiple viewings.  You will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors.  If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts.

The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960&apos;s) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket&apos;s dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.

The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60&apos;s, 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. 

The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.

The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.

As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn&apos;t compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn&apos;t a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars.

In addition, if you&apos;re not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We&apos;ll both be better off.

This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it&apos;s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.

This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.

But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.

That&apos;s your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can&apos;t really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don&apos;t, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.

What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John&apos;s safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson&apos;s house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who&apos;s confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).

With these players set in motion, it&apos;s up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they&apos;re evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn&apos;t cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you&apos;d think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.

Of course, this wouldn&apos;t be an action movie without some action. There&apos;s plenty of it, and it&apos;s perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they&apos;re completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you&apos;ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you&apos;ll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.

I&apos;m not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/,8.6,"['Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Linda Hamilton', 'Edward Furlong']",['James Cameron']

In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn&apos;t to say I didn&apos;t like it, but so many times I just couldn&apos;t understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it&apos;s practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it&apos;s very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!!

Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can&apos;t decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn&apos;t be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.

Enter &quot;The Pianist&quot;. With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman&apos;s point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg&apos;s rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.

While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; was supposed to be.

Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: &quot;I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.&quot;

The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. &quot;It&apos;s easy to be nice when you&apos;re rich,&quot; the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.

But it&apos;s a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they&apos;ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.

But in a meritocracy, you can&apos;t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it&apos;s all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.

Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to &quot;metaphors,&quot; and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you&apos;re like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you&apos;ve just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho&apos;s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he&apos;ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he&apos;s done so.

I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.

South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can&apos;t afford not to struggle.

The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the &quot;Indians&quot;) looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It&apos;s nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/,8.5,"['Song Kang-ho', 'Lee Sun-kyun', 'Cho Yeo-jeong']",['Bong Joon Ho']

Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It&apos;s hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it&apos;s not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.

Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won&apos;t even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).

The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.

However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.

Tatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film. This man takes on his roles with such prowess that it is easy for the viewer to forget that you have seen him play a different role in another movie.

An unusual relationship forms as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin&apos;s trade.",2008-02-18,1H50M,"Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or &quot;hit men&quot;. They&apos;re the standard &quot;badass&quot; character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). Léon, however, flips this cliché on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.

Léon begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who&apos;s moving in on Tony&apos;s territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon&apos;s human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin&apos; in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.

Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for Léon, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. Léon is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon&apos;s training of Mathilda, Mathilda&apos;s growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, Léon also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon&apos;s and Mathilda&apos;s characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.

Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.

Natalie Portman&apos;s breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.

In comparison to Jean Reno&apos;s fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor&apos;s career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.

The plot of Léon is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That&apos;s not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film&apos;s climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others&apos; lives. Overall, Léon is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/,8.5,"['Jean Reno', 'Gary Oldman', 'Natalie Portman']",['Luc Besson']

Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don&apos;t disagree with them.

But I&apos;d like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven&apos;t seen this film.  I&apos;d like to tell you HOW to watch it.

The people who made this movie didn&apos;t think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.

So as an audience member, you can&apos;t sit down expecting gilded greatness.

Don&apos;t have a Casablaca party.  Don&apos;t watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that &quot;Romantic Touch.&quot;  Don&apos;t watch it as part of your &quot;I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time&quot; Film School project.

Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it&apos;s 10:30pm and there&apos;s nothing on TV that&apos;s any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.

The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, &quot;Three little people don&apos;t amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.&quot;  If you&apos;re in a mood where you understand what he&apos;s saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.

There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don&apos;t amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.

But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.

 If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no &quot;hype,&quot; you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.

Happy viewing, kid.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/,8.5,"['Humphrey Bogart', 'Ingrid Bergman', 'Paul Henreid']",['Michael Curtiz']

The film is called &quot; The Usual Suspects&quot; and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as &apos;Verbal.&apos; From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It&apos;s through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it&apos;s haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible.

I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don&apos;t over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors &amp; countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored. 

Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity. 

The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen. 

The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe&apos;s life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter. 

Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc. 

The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris. 

On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It&apos;s approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of &quot;best movie of the year&quot;. 

I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored.

The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...

What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.

Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. 

The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. 

As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. 

The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn&apos;t have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. 

This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It&apos;s a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can&apos;t understand and can&apos;t negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It&apos;s a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It&apos;s a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains. 

All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn&apos;t just the Alien itself, it&apos;s the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can&apos;t shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title &quot;Alien&quot; doesn&apos;t just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/,8.5,"['Sigourney Weaver', 'Tom Skerritt', 'John Hurt']",['Ridley Scott']

First off, I saw this movie on the top 250, and it&apos;s #14 on top of that! I mean, it&apos;s gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I&apos;m a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie &quot;Rear Window&quot;, I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it&apos;s a good reference if it&apos;s from The Simpsons.

&quot;Rear Window&quot; is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years, this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart, he&apos;s just so great as L.B., I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn&apos;t even try, but you can&apos;t help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn&apos;t have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he&apos;s a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza, she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility, and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.&apos;s heart.

I loved the ending, to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza. I won&apos;t tell, you&apos;ll just have to trust me, it was a brilliant way to breath and smile again after all the suspense and drama. &quot;Rear Window&quot; is a true classic and I&apos;m extremely grateful to the reviewers of IMDb who saw this movie and gave it great reviews, and the writers of The Simpsons! If it were not for you guys, I nor other members of my generation would probably not view it! Let&apos;s keep this classic alive!

Then I discovered it really wasn&apos;t underrated; it&apos;s rated very high on most critics&apos; lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.

Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I&apos;m a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It&apos;s a romance between Charlie&apos;s tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.

I&apos;m not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as &quot;talkies&quot; were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the &quot;eccentric millionaire.&quot;

There&apos;s a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.

Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment.

In the movie Memento&apos;, we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction&apos;, Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. 

Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife&apos;s killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia&apos;. Although he can recall details of life before his accident&apos; Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.

Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento&apos; is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more. 

 Guy Pearce&apos;s role in Memento&apos; shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife&apos;s killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia&apos;, a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny&apos;, I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present. 

Memento&apos;s other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy&apos; (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano&apos;s performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy&apos;, as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy&apos;. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard&apos;s condition to advantage their own situations.

 Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard&apos;s wife, Catherine (C.S.I.&apos;s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.

Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento&apos; realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything. 

Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero&apos;, Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, &quot;Memory&apos;s unreliable ... Memory&apos;s not perfect. It&apos;s not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It&apos;s an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they&apos;re irrelevant if you have the facts.&quot;  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento&apos;, when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento&apos;. The one which sticks in my mind the most&apos; has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore&apos;, snorting smartly that you won&apos;t be even able to remember what I have said&apos;.  

So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento&apos; the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease&apos; patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane&apos;. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience.

Together, they set out on a journey that will alter the fate of mankind.",2008-06-27,1H38M,"Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in &quot;WALL·E&quot; is it. &quot;WALL·E&quot; eclipses even Andrew Stanton&apos;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar&apos;s best film to date and, call me crazy as I&apos;ve just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.

&quot;WALL·E&quot; is everything we&apos;ve come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton&apos;s screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the &apos;go green&apos; campaigns we&apos;re all so used to. Does &quot;WALL·E&quot; have a message? Sure, but it&apos;s an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.

&quot;WALL·E&quot; operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven&apos;t seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. &quot;WALL·E&quot; will never get points for originality but it doesn&apos;t exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (this one is particularly spectacular), &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; are actually homages and not ripoffs. &quot;WALL·E&quot; is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). 

The social commentary in &quot;WALL·E&quot; is sobering because it&apos;s never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.

What is most surprising about &quot;WALL·E&quot; is how sad it is. Not even in the &apos;how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them&apos; way &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It&apos;s a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E&apos;s only companion before EVE shows up, but I won&apos;t go into the story- it&apos;s best you see it unfold for yourself.

From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with &quot;WALL·E&quot;. This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don&apos;t think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than &quot;WALL·E&quot;, and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.

I remember one friend looking around and whispering to me in the S-Bahn - just in case one of the many &quot;IM&apos;s&quot; (unofficial workers of the Stasi) was listening in.

I visited a representative of a magazine for western countries about the GDR and spent one memorable weekend sightseeing with her. Near the end of my visit, she asked me if I would work for them regularly by writing my opinion of &quot;GDR Review&quot; and its suitability for readers in the West. I would be paid in GDR money to use during further visits. After politely refusing this &quot;offer&quot; (&quot;The police at home might not like it!&quot;), I always had a sneaking suspicion that that was an attempt by the Stasi to recruit me.

Years later I applied to see my &quot;Stasi File&quot;. I will never forget the feeling deep inside me when I read in it: &quot;..is not suitable for our use due to his apparent connection to the police in his homeland.&quot; The beautiful, friendly lady in Dresden had been a Stasi informer all the time! All of my visits to the GDR and the people I visited were listed in that file. For me &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; is an authentic representation of that totalitarian state.

A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.

In contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick&apos;s other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.

The light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers&apos; headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.

The use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.

The casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn&apos;t a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.

Throughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier&apos;s bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it&apos;s quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050825/,8.4,"['Kirk Douglas', 'Ralph Meeker', 'Adolphe Menjou']",['Stanley Kubrick']

The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power&apos;s character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.

Otherwise, it&apos;s a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. 

Laughton, who plays Power&apos;s defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power&apos;s wife. Laughton&apos;s dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He&apos;s just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn&apos;t have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.

Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton&apos;s nurse. She, too, demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.

The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing &quot;The Shining&quot; was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I&apos;ve ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And &quot;funny&quot; because of Jack Nicholson&apos;s outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since.

Charlie Chaplin is simply outstanding in this film in what was his first spoken role. To play two completely different characters, Hynkel and the Jewish barber, so convincingly in the same film is truly remarkable.

This forces Bruce Wayne to come out of hiding and don the cape and cowl of Batman again.",2021-02-16,2H44M,"&apos;The Dark Knight Rises&apos; is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan&apos;s groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as &apos;Bane&apos;, Anne Hathaway as &apos;Selina&apos;, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as &apos;Blake&apos; and Marion Cotillard as &apos;Miranda&apos;. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as &apos;Alfred Pennyworth&apos;. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce&apos;s relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it&apos;s heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to &apos;Batman Begins&apos; and &apos;The Dark Knight&apos;. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce&apos;s arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn&apos;t perfect, Bane&apos;s final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn&apos;t live up to the heights of &apos;The Dark Knight&apos; but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.

Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.

It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as &quot;...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful...&quot; or &quot;never stop smiling&quot;, parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are &quot;different&quot;, who are &quot;freaky&quot; to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.

With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film.  The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.

The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors.  The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.

Wolfgang Petersen&apos;s magnificent accomplishment in &quot;Das Boot&quot; is reiterating the dictum that &quot;war is hell&quot;, no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located.

*** Minor spoilers ***

The plot has been well described by other viewers so I won&apos;t rehash it again. But my personal observations, as an ex-submarine sailor, are that Petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately. I say &quot;probably&quot; because todays subs are hotels compared with the German U-boats and American submarines. The commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a &quot;sewer pipe&quot; for weeks at a time. More importantly, you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions (American WW2 subs used to be called &quot;pig boats&quot;), deals with an unfortunately believable political officer, deals with drills, actual torpedo firings, actual ships casualties, and deals, most frighteningly, with retribution from the &quot;enemy&quot;. My own experience watching the depth charging of the U-boat was such that I was thinking &quot;stop it, Stop It, STOP IT, STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT...!!!!!&quot; That&apos;s how real it felt to me. For the rest of you, I feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a WW2 U-boat.

This movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew (and ultimately the sub) together. Petersen&apos;s direction for Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock was masterful because it didn&apos;t portray the captain as a god. It showed him as a man who knows how to lead, knows his submarine as if he were married to it (and in many ways he is) but isn&apos;t perfect at the job. It also shows that even with great leadership qualities, Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock can not do the job alone: he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs, but to also advise the captain. Petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookie-cutter personalities that Hollywood feels is needed.

I could go on and on. So I will close by saying that with the plot, direction, cinematography, acting, sound, music, editing all being top notch, this is one of the few movies that I can truly rate a 10 out of 10. I also preferred the German version with subtitles.

------------------------------------ 

I believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use Steadicam technology. It was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine, specifically through the open watertight doors, without a break in the filming. Up until I heard what Steadicam was, I was always wondering how Petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung from.

(It turns out I was wrong: &quot;Bound For Glory&quot; was the first.)

EDIT (12 OCT, 2006): I have been corrected by an observant viewer. Wikipedia has the following comment on what I thought was Steadicam usage:

&quot;Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano&apos;s design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had a gyroscope to provide stability, a reinvention of the Steadicam on a smaller scale, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken.&quot; 

So, literally, a Steadicam was NOT used in the filming of &quot;Das Boot&quot;. However, a camera that resembled Steadicam in function (in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform) was used.

------------------------------------ 

Even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors, and we have refrigerators, freezers, air conditioning, are able to take showers, etc., there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on: the smell. While the smell of the &quot;pig boats&quot; of WW2 was truly atrocious, even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere, you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created, from burned toast in the galley, from the smell of the &quot;sanitary gasses&quot; (to be kind), to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel, all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You, as a sailor, may get used to it, but when you get home, your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately!",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/,8.4,"['Jürgen Prochnow', 'Herbert Grönemeyer', 'Klaus Wennemann']",['Wolfgang Petersen']

Just watch it.

Amazing characters, scenery, city life and town life, story. Everything is just wow. So fine! The suspension, the empathy, the scenes. The thoughts. It&apos;s playful and pleasant, but serious and funny at the same time. It makes you want to feel it and live it, while you just keep cheering for everything.

This 1.5 hours was one of the most well spent time in my life. It was so good, that I actually sit down and wondered why we can&apos;t we live like that? Why can&apos;t we be in that village? In that anime Tokyo?

Every minute is a time well-spent. It&apos;s a time SO well spent, that I was afraid when it&apos;s going to end. I literally just realized that this would be the end of an anime. Than this would be the end of an hour long movie.

I was so afraid when it&apos;s going to end. It borough such a beautiful and marvelous utopia before my eyes, with all it&apos;s mistakes, conflicts. That I actually wanted to live there. I actually realized however, that I&apos;m not good of a person to be worthy of such utopia.

However it is very close to reality. Every time something out of order happens, you remember. This is a certain reality. People can die, be ashamed, punished. Everything can end in a tragedy. But when something wrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: &quot;Why? Why aren&apos;t you moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?&quot; Than I remembered.. this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothing bad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, good people, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3 generation, why would anything happen now?

This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness, thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before. I&apos;m really glad I watched it.

Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film&apos;s music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani&apos;s screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan&apos;s finest film to date.. The film&apos;s climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...

To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...

My Rating: 9/10

Sadly, America didn&apos;t always repay the compliment.  Leone&apos;s were &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot;, money makers to be sure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh and Hathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwood films cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By the time that they caught on to Leone&apos;s genuine popular appeal, the director had already moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned as pretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western, the Heaven&apos;s Gate of its day. That film&apos;s canny blend of pop appeal and pure cinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), and helped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the early seventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made by Leone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that would encompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than do the Puzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, and finally realized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or so between conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself, by Robert De Niro&apos;s (&quot;Noodles&apos;&quot;) opium dream of the  American twentieth century, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, once again, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its densely multi-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon its release, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process. Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get a glimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few saw it properly in theaters, but the video version respects the director&apos;s intentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen television screen aspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviated his usual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled last project was the first released on video to most properly  resemble the true cinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatient with this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  This will eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don&apos;t get the earlier Leones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving.

Consider what&apos;s in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.

Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain.&quot;

There&apos;s not a misstep in the movie&apos;s entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (&quot;She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!&quot;) and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (&quot;Fit as a Fiddle,&quot; &quot;Good Mornin&apos;&quot;).

Not only that, but there&apos;s not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to &quot;You Were Meant for Me.&quot; Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.

The expression on my face as I sat there watching the credits scroll by seemed as worn and broken as that of the protagonist, Florya.

The film follows Florya as he &quot;joins&quot; (i.e. obtains a gun) a partisan group resisting the German advancements in the forests of his native Byelorussia during World War II. What he witnesses at the ripe age of 12 changes a once open-eyed, smiling face into a weathered, traumatized one that has experienced the unimaginable.

And of course the unimaginable were the Nazi atrocities committed during the war. Come and See does not focus on what the German Army did to the Jewish population but rather what they did to the native Soviet population. The Nazis were not only concerned with the utter destruction of the Jews but of the Bolshevik Party as well. And to Hitler that meant any man, woman, or child living under communist rule. And this &quot;cleansing&quot; fell into the hands of the SS who, as depicted in the movie, literally destroyed every sign of life.

Florya is able to escape death, unlike the rest of his family, but serves as a witness to the destruction and in this sense &quot;dies&quot; as his innocence and youth is lost. Klimov does a masterful job and depicting this slow death by concentrating on the facial expressions of Florya versus that of the Germans and both of their transformations over time. Klimov&apos;s Hitler montage at the end is especially moving and puts an interesting spin on the whole &quot;what if&quot; question.

This is the most historically accurate war movie I have ever seen and would highly recommend it to any war/history enthusiast. But I would also recommend it to any film watcher that realizes the goal of the medium which is to evoke emotion in the audience, and Come and See does just that.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/,8.3,"['Aleksey Kravchenko', 'Olga Mironova', 'Liubomiras Laucevicius']",['Elem Klimov']

Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I&apos;ve never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.

Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire.

This movie is directed by Richard Marquand (Jagged Edge) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Blade Runner), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Batman), Ian McDiarmid (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) and James Earl Jones (Conan the Barbarian).

The entire Jabba the Hutt opening is always one of my favorite sequences in the series and a great way to start the movie. Harrison Ford was hilarious both in his lines and his body language. He couldn&apos;t have been better cast. The escape scene in this is everything you could want and every scene on Endor is magic. The chase through the woods opening and the mystery and unveiling of the Ewoks was super cool.

It&apos;s been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it&apos;s deeply touching.

Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there&apos;s someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.

Some say &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.

Jim Carrey... wow! I&apos;ve always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It&apos;s like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!

Finally I have to mention Beck&apos;s cover of &quot;Everybody&apos;s Gotta Learn Sometime&quot;, which fits perfectly into the movie and won&apos;t leave my CD-Player for the next months.

A movie like &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like &quot;Bad Boys&quot; or &quot;The Fast &amp; The Furious&quot;, and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can&apos;t wait until it&apos;s released on DVD.

Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life&apos;s limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely &apos;hero&apos; of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it&apos;s all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed &apos;The Mummy&apos; by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he&apos;s learned that his life has a limit; it&apos;s time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.

Ikiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa, a man better known for his samurai films, but it&apos;s a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as &apos;our hero&apos; throughout the film, and at first this struck me as rather odd because, as I&apos;ve mentioned, he&apos;s probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed; but that&apos;s just it! This man is not a superhero samurai, but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn&apos;t want to be useless anymore. That&apos;s why he&apos;s &apos;our hero&apos;. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he&apos;s on screen - we&apos;re sorry that he&apos;s wasted his life, and we&apos;re sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However, despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out, there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life; because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way, it&apos;s easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.

It could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third - and this is true. The movie needs it&apos;s final third in order to finish telling the story, but it really doesn&apos;t work as well as the earlier parts did. However, Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you&apos;ve seen so far; that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044741/,8.3,"['Takashi Shimura', 'Nobuo Kaneko', 'Shin&apos;ichi Himori']",['Akira Kurosawa']

The idea of man&apos;s rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.&apos;s &quot;Zarathustra&quot;; there is a prominent passage called &quot;On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child&quot;, in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that &quot;man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman.&quot; The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, he makes it pretty clear that he doesn&apos;t have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to &quot;go under&quot;. Bowman&apos;s psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick&apos;s best 1960&apos;s-style attempt at depicting the mystical &quot;going under&quot;.

I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of &quot;Zarathustra&quot; updated for the modern age.

To make a comparison in the world of music, this movie, like Mahler&apos;s 8th symphony, is a universe contained within itself.

Of course, it is an exercise in self-denial and philistinism to watch this movie in anything other than the wide-screen - or &quot;letterbox&quot; - format, due to Lean&apos;s complete use of every inch of the wide screen. To watch it otherwise is to miss half of Lean&apos;s intention.

Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer&apos;s mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film&apos;s story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn&apos;t have a great future ahead of them.

Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn&apos;t know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal&apos;s nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal&apos;s story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.

Incendies already had great source material. I&apos;ve praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It&apos;s impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can&apos;t imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there&apos;s some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn&apos;t autobiographical.

Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve&apos;s advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne&apos;s lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn&apos;t receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.

There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could&apos;ve lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/,8.3,"['Lubna Azabal', 'Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin', 'Maxim Gaudette']",['Denis Villeneuve']

I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock&apos;s direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people&apos;s heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10.

A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.

On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today&apos;s standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today&apos;s world.

My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don&apos;t agree with AFI&apos;s number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/,8.3,"['Orson Welles', 'Joseph Cotten', 'Dorothy Comingore']",['Orson Welles']

I recently was able to see the restored version of &quot;Metropolis&quot; on the big screen, and was delighted to see &quot;M&quot; on the Sundance channel - especially since it was the uncut version.  M follows the trail of a child killer (Peter Lorre), sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation. 

 This film is ground-breaking for many reasons:  It is Fritz Lang&apos;s first talking picture, it is one of the first in the serial killer genre and it was overtly anti-Nazi.  This film was banned in Germany shortly after it premiered, and Fritz Lang and Peter Lorre, both Jews, soon fled the country. It has superb acting (most notably, Peter Lorre&apos;s trial scene in the catacombs) and very stark yet at times gritty cinematography.  The story is indeed suspenseful and at times, very creepy (what whistling child killer isn&apos;t?).  The entire movie, however is extremely thought-provoking and challenging, much like the German Expressionist movement itself. 

 This is not a movie for everyone; some may find it boring, some may find it too abstract. It also has one of the most bizarre shots I&apos;ve ever seen in film - essentially it&apos;s a 30 second shot of the police inspector talking on the phone, but you&apos;re under his desk and looking up his pants leg.  It actually kind of baffled me and made me chuckle for a second, but it was avant garde if anything.

To those who appreciate early cinema that truly makes you think, both about the film and the subtext with which it was written and filmed, it is a must-see.

While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock&apos;s other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.

If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events.  Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere.  The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort.  It&apos;s the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.

There are also some great acting performances.  Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona.  He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character&apos;s actions and decisions.  Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance.  The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie&apos;s (Stewart&apos;s) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie&apos;s character.

Her quest to spread joy leads her on a journey during which she finds true love.",2002-12-03,2H2M,"Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet&apos;s Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain

For 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain. But it&apos;s popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain&apos;, obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn&apos;t win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.

I consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet&apos;s film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.

Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie&apos;s mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie&apos;s apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven&apos;t noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.

The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.

Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie&apos;s mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie&apos;s father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino&apos;s red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.

Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can&apos;t imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It&apos;s wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie&apos;s mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director&apos;s choice, so I don&apos;t hold her responsible for that.

 Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie&apos;s pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer&apos;s door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key&apos;s silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn&apos;t been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie&apos;s heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old&apos;s man face, a close-up of Amélie&apos;s hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.

 Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.

In my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/,8.3,"['Audrey Tautou', 'Mathieu Kassovitz', 'Rufus']",['Jean-Pierre Jeunet']

**** (out of 4) 

Set at some point in the future, British teen Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) spends most of his time hanging with his goon friends, raping women and causing other violent harm but after he&apos;s caught he volunteers for an experimental therapy that doesn&apos;t quite work as planned. Sick, shocking, crude, violent, nauseating and vulgar are just a few of the words that many will use when describing this film but I&apos;d call it a true piece of art that rightfully deserves its high reputation. Many people have said that a Kubrick film would never be a Kubrick film if it wasn&apos;t an ego-maniac you took his sweet time to make sure what made it to the screen was his vision and only his vision. There&apos;s something beautiful about a painter taking his time to make sure his painting has all the right colors and vibes yet if a filmmaker does this he&apos;s often criticized for it. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that Kubrick was a mad genius and that&apos;s never more evident in this adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel. To me the greatest thing about this movie is its sick and twisted sense of humor but also the visual look of the film. It&apos;s amazing what Kubrick can do in the matter of seconds but the masterful and now legendary opening sequence only lasts a few seconds yet it pulls you into this bizarre world of sex and murder. These two objects are never a funny thing yet Kubrick pulls us into this world where we can laugh at them and follow our &quot;hero&quot; Alex as he rapes one person after another, murders and fights only for us to eventually come to see him as the good guy and a victim. I&apos;m sure one could make this film a very political one and many arguments have been raged about the meaning of the ending but everyone who watches the film will draw something different from it and I&apos;m sure ones own opinion on what&apos;s done to our hero will have you seeing the ending in different ways. For me personally, the film has always been an incredibly dark comedy that works simply because the world we&apos;re watching might be set in the future but you could call it ahead of its time just like METROPOLIS was. It takes place in the future with the bizarre sets and weird culture yet at the same time the subject matter is so today that you can&apos;t help but feel you&apos;re in the middle of some nightmare. McDowell&apos;s performance is a truly great one as he perfectly plays both the psychotic Alex but also the victim. I thought some of McDowell&apos;s greatest work here comes once he&apos;s cured and can no longer tolerate violence. What&apos;s even better is the narration, which is downright superb and wonderfully used by the director with the actor perfectly delivering the lines and helping one get into the story. You&apos;ll also never hear &quot;Singin&apos; in the Rain&quot; the same way again. Some people call the film overindulgent, which is probably is but I see this as a good thing. This just helps create this strange world and in the end it&apos;s really unlike any movie ever made and there&apos;s just something so unique in its vision that you can&apos;t help but feel this is something from the future. Kubrick&apos;s vision has never been questioned and fans could debate on which of his features has the greatest look but for my money it&apos;s this film. That&apos;s not to say this is the director&apos;s greatest film but I do think it has the great look and feel. It&apos;s certainly a very violent movie but the director gives the violence such a pleasant nature that it just seems normal and rather light. The strange music selection, crazy camera shots and overall strange tone makes it a one of a kind and that&apos;s why A CLOCKWORK ORANGE will always be a timeless work of art.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/,8.2,"['Malcolm McDowell', 'Patrick Magee', 'Michael Bates']",['Stanley Kubrick']

I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  

I first read Harper Lee&apos;s lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.

Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  

Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.

The best thing about &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child&apos;s eyes.

This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who&apos;s intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber&apos;s diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists&apos; overwhelming power.

My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers&apos; attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line &quot;Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er&quot;. The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film&apos;s main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!

Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/,8.2,"['Bruce Willis', 'Alan Rickman', 'Bonnie Bedelia']",['John McTiernan']

I didn&apos;t think Robert Redford and Paul Newman would be able to top &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,&quot; their previous film together, but they totally did. It&apos;s a great plot that ends up &quot;stinging&quot; not only the characters but the audience as well (see it to find out what I mean). It&apos;s a great balance between comedy and drama; it can be quite dramatic, but when it&apos;s funny, it&apos;s very funny. The plot involves Newman and Redford taking revenge on a gangster who killed one of their men. It&apos;s a complex, fun-filled story that entertains and mesmerizes. Some people are shot with guns, but nothing in the film is too difficult for the average person to watch, in my opinion. Not only are Newman and Redford excellent, but so is the supporting cast, including Robert Shaw, Harold Gould, and Charles Durning. The film won Best Picture of 1973, which was deserved.

And when in this moment of dearth one gets treated to a movie that simply touches the soul - needless to say - Taare Zameen Par - does just that.

Aamir Khan proves his mettle as a director. As an actor he is fabulous. The story captures a look at a middle class family who feel the younger kid (Darsheel Safary) is not a patch on the elder one who is a topper at class. The younger one is always struggling with his ABCs and spends more time out of his class rather than inside.

Its only when he is sent to boarding school with the hope that an iron fist will help him improve that he comes across art teacher (Aamir Khan) who correctly identities his problem of suffering from dyslexia and decides to unleash his creativity and make him an achiever.

To know more one should watch this movie since it has elements that everyone could relate towards while at school or boarding, and brings into focus the need for underprivileged and slow learning children to be given the chance to prove themselves with patience and love that would help them merge with mainstream education and become worthwhile contributors.

Brilliant job Aamir and your team for treating the subject with respect, honesty and flair. Darsheel Safary as the struggling kid has done total justice to his role and puts in a performance that will always be remembered.

It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. 

I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy&apos;s dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit &amp; charm along with Indy&apos;s usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; isn&apos;t by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix&apos; laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.

This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg&apos;s output: A young Indiana &quot;beginning&quot; his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat &quot;You lost today kid, but that doesn&apos;t mean you have to like it.&quot; and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. 

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There&apos;s a bit of kissing/banter, and it&apos;s implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there&apos;s ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn&apos;t need another sequel after third release. There&apos;s nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy&apos;s Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it&apos;s up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.

The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097576/,8.2,"['Harrison Ford', 'Sean Connery', 'Alison Doody']",['Steven Spielberg']

In addition to being a very impressive technical achievement for its time, the film is well known as the very first feature-length sci fi film. While it wasn&apos;t met with a very warm reception upon its release (not to mention having been cut since then), it has made a massive impact over the decades for its biting allegory and themes of purity mixed in with knowledge and strength.

Set in a futuristic urban dystopia, high class city planner Joh Fredersen lives in the Tower of Babel around the prestigious city, which is atop its underground equivalent filled with workers who manage the machinery that support it. The actual story revolves around Joh&apos;s son Freder and the holy figure Maria trying to overcome the major split between the two parts. Director Fritz Lang and writer Thea von Harbou develop the film&apos;s plot through world building, as it&apos;s made clear from the start that the workers of the surface-level power plant toil with the equipment tirelessly year by year. Satirically, the workers are the clocks controlled by the ringleader Frederson. In a way, the film lets the viewers think about the societal differences between individuals and power without spoon-feeding the message as much as showcasing it through distinctive nations.

Admittedly, the film doesn&apos;t really develop the characters outside of their basic tropes and goals, but they&apos;re by no means bad. If anything, they&apos;re meant more to guide the events of the different classes throughout the story&apos;s progression. Freder knows all the wrong doings of tampering with technology, therefore he wishes there to be a proper balance between the thinkers and the builders, hence why he adores Maria so much. Speaking of Maria, she is the saintly guide to the workers looking for hope, but her purity comes at a price of the mad scientist Rotwag who builds a robot to replicate his loved one Hel (who ended up becoming Freder&apos;s mother). Without spoiling much, let&apos;s just say that what he does to Maria really causes the film to get suspenseful. The remaining cast are mainly easily manipulated individuals looking for the right voice to lead them.

But of course, the feature&apos;s visual style is timelessly breathtaking. Most of the special effects were huge innovations at a time of severe technological limitations, and some even work as substance depending on some given scenes (like the mythos behind the Tower of Babel). Many of the contraptions and backdrops have clearly inspired the likes of Blade Runner, Futurama and even Batman over the years, mainly through the gothic architect and abstract landscapes. Admittedly, a lot of the acting is really over the top by today&apos;s standards, but that&apos;s more attributed to the dynamic gestural performances commonplace back in the day. That, and many scenes do kind of drag on a bit for their own good. However, the narrative and message are meant to be told through these elaborate sets and melodramatic performances to gain the necessary emotional resonance for such an ambitious project like this.

In conclusion, Metropolis is a prime example of how something can stand the test of time through technical brilliance and emotional resonance based on a political allegory. It&apos;s funny how Fritz Lang believed this film to be the prediction of how the future would be perceived back in the 1920s, because it&apos;s not too far off from today. Technology is a great usage and all, but all the amazing knowledge and manual labor in the world are nothing without the necessary negotiating in case one spirals out of control, something that many corporations these days fail to realize. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely feel free to do so to remind yourself how important it is to maintain order around advanced infrastructure.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/,8.3,"['Brigitte Helm', 'Alfred Abel', 'Gustav Fröhlich']",['Fritz Lang']

When the three come together on a coffee shop killing that brings in elements of cases they are following they solve it together.  However each has suspicions that something is not right.

I&apos;m sorry to say that I didn&apos;t pick up on this at the cinema and it wasn&apos;t until the Oscars brought it to my attention that I first saw it.  Since then I have seen it several times and have enjoyed it every time.  The plot is slightly complex (although maybe not by the genre&apos;s standards) and it isn&apos;t simplified for the audiences sake  it respects the audience enough to trust us to keep up with it&apos;s pace.  The film is split into three strands dictated by the characters, they are not quite distinct but are mostly intertwined the whole way through  coming together in the final hour to great effect.

The pace of the telling is great; it has moments of drama, of tension and great action.  Hanson has done a great job with the direction, he has a great sense of place and time to his 50&apos;s Hollywood  whether it be the stars&apos; lives or the black suburbs  but he directs each scene with a sense of tension and urgency that the material deserves.  The final twist is OK if not great but it is more the telling of the story that is enjoyable, not just the denouncement.

The casting did a great job of getting growth names and established qualities but no one huge star who could dominate the film.  It is the Australian stars that stand out here.  Pearce is excellent with a subtly changing character but it is Crowe that sticks in the memory with a very strong character and a performance to match.  Spacey is as quality as he ever is (or at least, was for a few years either side of this film) and the support cast is as good with De Vito, Basinger, Cromwell, Rifkin, Strathairn and Guilfoyle.

There is nothing I really dislike about this film.  The longer than average running time is not a problem as it easily fills it without dragging at any point.  The film oozes class and has a great tough plot from Ellroy where nothing is as simple as right/wrong and everything comes together at the end.

You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode.

This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. 

You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis&apos;s mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. 

This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle &apos;You talking to me? Well I&apos;m the only one here.&apos; and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it&apos;s finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh &amp; gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. 

This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70&apos;s. An unsettling gem of a film.

In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America&apos;s system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he&apos;s calling to hustle you at home and you don&apos;t even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort&apos;s lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That&apos;s the way it works, and it&apos;s impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.

There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.

The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.

The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort&apos;s character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex &amp; drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort&apos;s sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort&apos;s second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort&apos;s mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.

Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that &quot;most-addictive drug&quot; Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one&apos;s lifestyle but the effects it has on one&apos;s morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.

With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese&apos;s best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that&apos;s already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it&apos;s one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/,8.2,"['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Jonah Hill', 'Margot Robbie']",['Martin Scorsese']

Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman &amp; Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze &quot;You&apos;re not sending me to the cooler&quot;, wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it&apos;s a shame it didn&apos;t start off this way as it might not of died on it&apos;s rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it&apos;s not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne&apos;s past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you&apos;ve not seen it I don&apos;t want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

Lee Van Cleef makes this a superior spaghetti western. He&apos;s not only as good as Clint. In many ways, he plays a superior character. His character has secrets. He has mysteries.

Immensely charming comedy set among Chicago and Miami , being starred by an all-star-cast . When two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit , the St Valentine massacre in Chicago carried out by mobster chief (George Raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for Florida , but further complications set in. There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters&apos; retaliation . 

Rightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I&apos;m through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O&apos;Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line . 

The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It&apos;s the kind of movie where you know what&apos;s coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/,8.2,"['Marilyn Monroe', 'Tony Curtis', 'Jack Lemmon']",['Billy Wilder']

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.

The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.

This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.

This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.

The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.

The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.

Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.

I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.

Here we have a film that is both truly great and in a different way a clumsy mistake.

By now you know that this was made by a master filmmaker at the end of his life -- in preparation for ten years and Asia&apos;s most expensive film. He intended it to be his last, his masterpiece.

The Good: This work of art is a sequence of masterfully composed images. The camera remains stationary or virtually so, and each scene is richly rewarding in all the visual dimensions, including motion. The costumes are the most cinematic I have seen. There is a use of grasshopper sounds that is the best example I know of amplifying an image by sound. The frame of the picture is the landscape -- little takes place indoors, and that action always refers to some larger, exterior motion. In my experience, this is the best complement of Wells&apos; Othello, the most masterful use of interior space I know.

I give it a ten because it is a masterpiece in this area of cinematic communication, one that seems exceptionally underaddressed.

The Bad: The Master attempted too much in trying to match his cinematic virtuosity by swallowing Shakespeare&apos;s Lear to produce an equally rich story. In this he fails -- so many problems here. First, Shakespeare wrote plays for a barren stage where the images grow from the mind, supported by super-rich language and interwoven visual metaphor. The scene grows from our understanding of the character and what that character says. Kurosawa tries it backwards here by placing characters is a vast scheme that came from his own mind, off-screen as it were, and it doesn&apos;t quite work.

As it happens, Ran&apos;s emphasis is on grand motion. Little time is spent on character development, except with the scheming wife of the first son (a story element that has little Shakespearean counterpart). Lear is a play about demons and leaves the question open as to how many are from opportunistic devilment and which are internally generated. All this is discarded here, as well as the Gloucester counterplot. Among the great losses from the source are the continuous examinations of what sight means and what it can conceive. How fertile that would have been as dramatic scaffolding for Kurosawa&apos;s vision.

There&apos;s a problem with language as well. Not knowing Japanese, I cannot judge how rich or intricate in metaphor is the film&apos;s dialogue. But the sound and dramatic utility of the speech is about as far from Shakespeare as you can get. Shakespeare uses his actors&apos; speech to simultaneously move the dramatic action and to serve as a surrogate for the viewer&apos;s mind. Both the story and your own ruminations on the story are contained therein. This depends on a continuous, predictable assumed rythmic base which is articulated by a rich consonant based, cheating rubato. Japanese consists of staccato vowels that I suspect are overly dramatized in the short blasts we get from these characters. Could hardly be more unShakespearean. I assume there is a Noh legacy being mined here instead, which is not available to this western viewer.

No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he&apos;s as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he&apos;s ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise&apos;s regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They&apos;re tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, &quot;Hold My Hand.&quot; It&apos;s nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie&apos;s &quot;Take My Breath Away,&quot; but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you&apos;re really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that&apos;s because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he&apos;s trying to show us that there&apos;s room for the old and the new to coexist.

The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don&apos;t expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he&apos;s on screen you can&apos;t take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could.

 The Thing

 Directed by: John Carpenter, 1982

 Looking back on John Carpenter&apos;s The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.

 Steven Spielberg&apos;s extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter&apos;s first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.

 It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter&apos;s version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks&apos; version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell&apos;s short story &quot;Who Goes There?&apos; (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.

 It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.

 This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.

 Ennio Morricone&apos;s moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.

 A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.

 The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There&apos;s a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey&apos;s extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.

 Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there&apos;s a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.

An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.

 Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott&apos;s 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There&apos;s a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott&apos;s in every way.

 The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).

 Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that&apos;s not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.

 Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/,8.2,"['Kurt Russell', 'Wilford Brimley', 'Keith David']",['John Carpenter']

A tribute to the previous masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.

Eastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guilt-filled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the town, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax, welcoming back a sort of &apos;Man With No Name&apos; character to the genre.

William Munny is a cold-blooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But, all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn&apos;t die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now, but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man, of which deserved it, he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination, he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.

The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless (see Tarantino or Scorsese films) and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn&apos;t worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken, it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide (Munny and Little Bill) or kills someone and calls it a day (Kid and Logan), because they can&apos;t bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thought-provoking thing for me personally, ever.

Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually, its the greatest film of all-time. It shows how violent it was back then, and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone&apos;s &apos;Man With No Name&apos; films (though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land). But, Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol; which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are, either cowards or killers. The choice of word &apos;coward&apos; is to say that they should be killers, as that is apparently what a man is (an exaggeration) as most westerns glorify violence, but the men can&apos;t handle it.

Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way; like when asked if he killed women and children he replied &quot;I&apos;ve killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another, and I&apos;m here to kill you&quot;. He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade, the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.

The script, written by David Webb Peoples, buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years, even being rejected by some of the cast, before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of &apos;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&apos; or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view, yet also being extremely raw. The score, though not used often is very refreshing and moving.

&apos;Unforgiven&apos; is an unforgettable look on life, man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the &apos;90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.

Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show &quot;Monk&quot; has become.

Crowe&apos;s character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as &quot;Monk,&quot; but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don&apos;t take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain&apos;t so. (One example: in real life, Nash&apos;s wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)

The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn&apos;t have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I&apos;m not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005&apos;s &quot;Cinderella Man.&quot;

For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven&apos;t seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise.

Dobbs. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are down and out and meet up with prospector Howard (Walter Huston). When Dobbs wins a lottery, he uses the proceeds to finance a trip for the three to central Mexico to search for gold. 

The three have to deal with the lawlessness of central Mexico at the time - bandits were actually on the loose in that country killing anybody with stuff, and taking that stuff. The Federales were a violent solution to a violent problem - killing the bandits after a summary judgement and the bandits having dug their own graves. So our trio not only have to worry about bandits once they strike gold, they have to worry about the darkness of their own souls. 

In the beginning, Bogart&apos;s Fred C. Dobbs is a decent guy who does not take advantage of others. Dobbs only takes his money from the guy that wouldn&apos;t pay and he does share his lottery ticket and is generous with his fellow miners, but as greed begins to take root in him, little by little we see his goodness eaten away. It&apos;s a great credit to the writing and Bogart&apos;s skills that this is done gradually and played out over time. Incidentally, that&apos;s director John Huston &quot;staking him to a meal&quot;. One of the best director cameos ever (although Polanski in Chinatown is equally great)! 

Dobbs overestimates himself and the fallibility of human nature. Walter Hustons character freely admits what gold could do to any of them including himself. Dobbs is sure it will never happen to him, but he&apos;s never had anything, so he&apos;s never faced temptation, and when he falls it&apos;s a long way down. 

This may be Tim Holt&apos;s finest performance - it was probably his finest opportunity given he had spent years laboring as a B western star on the RKO lot. Walter Huston as the prospector, minus his dentures and plus a bunch of pounds and with holes in his clothes is not the debonair fellow you are used to seeing in film . If Mary Astor&apos;s character in Dodsworth could have thought this was the future appearance of the man she loved, would she have taken her gondola in the other direction? I guess we&apos;ll never know.

He arrives at a gang-war ravaged town and starts hiring himself out to both sides, playing them off against another, in order to wipe all the scum out. Sound familiar?

Even though Yojimbo the film is a thrilling ride and very funny dark comedy, it is hard to imagine what a bombshell this was for audiences at the time of its release. It is as far removed as can be from the then squeaky-clean aesthetic of samurai films: you can almost smell the sweat and the grime of the sordid town and characters.

It exploded beyond the confines of its own country and genre, forever influencing the very Westerns that had inspired it, particularly a new wave out of Spain and Italy at the time. One Sergio Leone copy/pasted the whole plot into his own revisionist Western and gave us the Dollars trilogy. The slightest of Spaghetti Western enthusiasts owes Kurosawa a debt of gratitude.

His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is an RV that had been parked on their s...",2013-09-09,2H33M,"Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. 

Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover&apos;s each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. 

Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover&apos;s suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.

The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard&apos;s Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. 

The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman&apos;s performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.

The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. 

Denis Villeneuve&apos;s last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.

405,Finding Nemo (2003) - IMDb,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NjExNTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQ0ODY2._V1_.jpg,"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.",2005-10-15,1H40M,"I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;The Incredibles&quot; to DreamWorks films like &quot;Shrek.&quot; But &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies and in &quot;Monsters Inc.,&quot; but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children&apos;s animated film.

Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I&apos;m sure Gary Larson of &quot;Far Side&quot; fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what&apos;s going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you&apos;ll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.

Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that&apos;s like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.

The story employs the same basic formula used in &quot;Toy Story,&quot; in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they&apos;re forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I&apos;m glad the filmmakers didn&apos;t lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film&apos;s biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film&apos;s director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.

Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They&apos;re just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, &quot;Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.&quot; That&apos;s perhaps the film&apos;s most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/,8.2,"['Albert Brooks', 'Ellen DeGeneres', 'Alexander Gould']","['Andrew Stanton', 'Lee Unkrich']"

And this is Monty Python at its typical best. If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.

The jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (&quot;I am Roger the Shrubber&quot;) to more subtle and intelligent jokes (&quot;I thought we were an autonomous collective&quot; / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there&apos;s something for everyone. No one is left out.

What many don&apos;t realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don&apos;t understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn&apos;t have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (&quot;Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!&quot;). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience&apos;s vocabulary.

Behind his monstrous façade, there is revealed a person of kindness, intelligence and sophistication.",2004-12-22,2H4M,"Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it&apos;s credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it&apos;s title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it&apos;s title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that&apos;s all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that&apos;s all it needs, so that&apos;s all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.

The film is also ironic. Aside from it&apos;s visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he&apos;s had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society&apos;s upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it&apos;s a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn&apos;t care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By &apos;normal&apos; people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn&apos;t something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, &quot;we can&apos;t imagine the life he&apos;s had&quot;. We can&apos;t.

David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today&apos;s society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.

To put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it&apos;s a masterpiece.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080678/,8.2,"['Anthony Hopkins', 'John Hurt', 'Anne Bancroft']",['David Lynch']

The story he used for Rashomon is now, like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, and Yojimbo, a near archetype that at this point in the history of film has become formula and common knowledge for writers and directors. In that sense, Rashomon is as important and entertaining as a film as Citizen Kane, Battleship Potemkin, Rear Window, or Open City. Tee basic premise- Four different people give four different accounts on the rape and murder of a couple in the woods. A key ingredient to the success of Rashomon, is that the recollections given to the courts by the woman, the bandit, the as well as the four in discussion, is that their emotions reveal their humanity, even if their details reveal nothing, or everything. It&apos;s difficult to say whether character goes over story here, or if they have equal importance to understand Kurosawa&apos;s psychology with these people. 

The opening shot of the house is a perfect representation of the mature of the picture, something that has fallen apart over time due to disasters that go beyond control of individuals. The man who heard the testimonies of the trial says &quot;I don&apos;t understand&quot;. This has been a discussed line, since essentially he&apos;s saying the point right up front. All the information won&apos;t ease his puzzlement. The three who discuss the details of the crimes and confessions are crucial- they speak for us, what our opinions might be, and we listen to each version of the story, the characters, the fears, the pride, the shame, and the search for judgment and/or truth in the situation.

Along with being director and co-adapter, Kurosawa&apos;s mastery is revealed heavily in his use of editing- there are short, fleeting moments that hint, or rather pronounce, emotions and thoughts. For instance, when we first see Tajomaru, the bandit, played by action-legend Toshiro Mifune, he is looking up at the sky, bound in straps to keep him from moving, and for a second, or less than a second, there&apos;s a shot of what he sees in the sky, then back to his face which reveals an expression that borders on skeptical, and a bit crazed, or more. Mifune&apos;s part is of a barbarian, but all the more believable as a human barbarian since he acts as such with animal desires- he sees the woman in the woods, and knows he wants her, and while he reflects that he didn&apos;t have to have killed the man, he did as a last resort as a man with an urge. This is intensified by a sadistic flee with his actions. 

What&apos;s intriguing about that first description/recollection of the battle between him and the other man, is that it seems like it could be the truth, and to one viewer it could, and to another it seems like it could all be apart of his hyperactive and trapped imagination. And in the attack of the bandit on the woman, at first to him, it&apos;s like a game, then in later descriptions, he feels a little more un-easy, then later, it&apos;s of neither pleasure or discomfort, it just is. This kind of technique later happens with the woman who was victim (who has conviction, though is herself an archetype of Lifetime women), the presence who saw it &quot;all&quot;, and with the man who in the beginning didn&apos;t understand. In each telling the expressions, the cut-aways, the lighting and movement by Kazuo Miyagawa, it&apos;s equally startling, exhilarating. 

That the film gives off such a hypnotic aura isn&apos;t surprising, or perhaps it is for those in the grips of the emotion of it all- the dead man&apos;s story is like the hook ripping into a twelve foot bass. The final accouter of the tale proves the most accurate to the common observer, yet Kurosawa knows that&apos;s not the point- if he made it as such to be bold AND had a definite concrete point, the ending would be as poignant when revealed is the truth, or what one could believe as the closest thing to it is. We know why that last person didn&apos;t want to get involved with the courts with what he knows: his story is no more a revelation, of any comfort or consolation to the listeners, than the others. I highly recommend this to anyone, and to those who have distaste to foreign films should view it once anyway- it&apos;s certainly not a long movie, and it won&apos;t loose its grip on anyone willing to give itself to the tale(s). For me, it&apos;s another to add to my top 50 of all time.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/,8.2,"['Toshirô Mifune', 'Machiko Kyô', 'Masayuki Mori']",['Akira Kurosawa']

So many characters that appeared in the book couldn&apos;t be introduced in the movie without extending the film&apos;s length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film.

Fueled by Polanski-Nicholson synergy, anchored by one of greatest-ever original screenplays (written by Los Angeles native Robert Towne), brought to movie-life via PanaVision by brilliant cinematographer John Alonzo, and produced by the industry icon Robert Evans, this is one of film&apos;s greatest works of art, and being imo one of the top 20 greatest films ever made - it is a must-see movie.

Chinatown represents the art of film-making in its finest form, exceeding expectations in every reel.

This was Polanski&apos;s last film he made in the USA, and the best and last opportunity to see Nicholson&apos;s brilliant acting prowess before his characterization method became (to a large degree) a caricature of himself (albeit doing so perhaps better than any other icon-level movie-star).

Often, this much talent on one set becomes a disappointment. Not this time.

Like many successful collaborations, there were major style differences between Evans, Polanski and Towne - Such &quot;manageable stress&quot; can sink a film, but instead served as a positive catalyst in raising the bar of production and execution.

For those who haven&apos;t seen the film, it is &quot;required&quot; viewing. For those who haven&apos;t seen it in a while, cue it up, and enjoy - like most great films, it just seems to get better with age.

Polanski&apos;s style of film making utilizes a classic Noir movie-making &quot;complete-the-scene&quot; method before moving on - similar to live theatre (Act I, Scene 1, etc) The benefit is fulfilling each scene&apos;s importance to the story and film as a whole - this style works well in Noir films, and his set-up, detailing, and execution is brilliant.

The immaculately detailed set designs, wardrobe, makeup, and authentic restored vintage cars were painstakingly orchestrated by Polanski to transport us back to atmosphere and feel of the golden age of Hollywood circa 1937.

When Smeerensburg&apos;s new postman, Jesper, befriends toymaker Klaus, their gifts melt an age-old feud and deliver a sleigh full of holiday traditions.",2019-11-15,1H36M,"This is what this film feels like: sitting around a fire and being engrossed in a story that someone remembers from long ago. Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special. Here, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn&apos;t rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids&apos; interest. It just tells a story.

The story is about a spoiled young man who is sent into the little backwater village of Smeerensburg to take over the post office. Jesper has to deliver 6000 letters by the end of a year or he&apos;ll be cut off by his wealthy father. After he meets the reclusive toymaker Klaus, Jesper starts to plot his way out of Smeerensburg by roping in the kids of the village. Along the way he makes some friends, changes some lives and, well, grows up.

This is, in a way, Jesper&apos;s coming of age story, even though he is a fully grown man to begin with. But this is also Klaus&apos; growing old story. I found this apect very touching - the old and widowed hermit finds a new purpose in his life and gets to be happy for a few years yet. You do not see that sort of plotline in animated movies very often. The subplot of the warring clans of Smeerensburg was hilarious and reminded me a little of Asterix and Obelix.

Apart from the old school, but very well executed plot, it is worthwhile to talk about Klaus&apos; technical realization. Firstly, the animation is gorgeous. The lighting is magnificent. The look is excellent. This film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as a Christmas movie should. The handdrawn animation is very effective - it gives the film a very soft and almost canvas-like feeling, while still making good use of the smooth and fast execution that CGI affords.

Klaus isn&apos;t dunked in polished, on-the-nose effects, but is, you might say, warmly covered in a carefully crafted blanket of twinkling forest lights and harsh mountain snows and accompanied by a little, gruff town of crooked and funny looking houses and crooked and funny-looking people. In Klaus, we do not encounter a string of slightly altered clones, that all have the same body type and facial features (looking at you Disney) but a jumbled ensemble of big and round, tall and bent, young and middle aged and old characters, who all look and act differently from each other.

The only criticism I can honestly think of is that Klaus lacks a little on female representation. Its central female characters, Ava and Márgu, felt a little sidelined to me, especially given the fact that theirs could have been the better story, if told accordingly. But given the fact that I still loved it, I can&apos;t really hold this against Klaus.

So, just in time for Christmas, Klaus is a thoroughly enjoyable treat of a movie that I will probably recommend excessively over the next few weeks.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/,8.2,"['Jason Schwartzman', 'J.K. Simmons', 'Rashida Jones']","['Sergio Pablos', 'Carlos Martínez López']"

Direction of the movie is flawless,this movie is almost perfect in all the departments.I hardly found any mistake in the movie.

This movie deserves at least three Oscar nomination this year for screenplay ,cinematography and best movie in foreign language.

This movie is a masterpiece and will be remembered among greatest movies ever made(at least by me).

I first watched &quot;Snatch&quot;, which came after this film. Loved it. Watch this film, which had a similar set-up (the interwoven gangster theme). Loved it. As far as I&apos;m concerned, if Ritchie can maintain this level of creativity, he can keep on making these films until the end of time. His characters are so well scripted and the actors so well chosen, there is a three-dimensional quality to this film, as if you can almost taste the sulfur in the shotgun blasts.

To describe the plot is difficult, unless we choose one character as the hero and the rest as the anti-heroes... but that&apos;s hard to do. While certain people seem to be on our side, they&apos;re all equally involved in the plot. Kids playing poker, a porn king who cheats at cards, Big Chris the hired thug, the stereotyped black ganja dealer, Barry the Baptist... all great characters.

Another aspect of Ritchie&apos;s films is that instead of good vs. evil, he offers us bad versus evil. All the characters do bad things: steal, drink, smoke dope and kill if necessary. But some are simply &quot;bad&quot; (people who would be morally upright in a different setting) and others are &quot;evil&quot; (no moral code at all, black all the way to the core of their heart). This almost non-dichotomy is probably not unique to Ritchie, but is something he excels in.

Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Eleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.

INSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they&apos;re actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent&apos;s point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.

There&apos;s no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we&apos;re really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there&apos;s a &quot;long term memory&quot; section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the &quot;emotion&quot; characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there&apos;s no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.

As I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I&apos;m sure the majority of young children aren&apos;t fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time. Fans of Pixar are certainly going to love this as it&apos;s another winner that manages to work no matter what your age is. Still, I think the older you are the more you&apos;ll enjoy it.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/,8.1,"['Amy Poehler', 'Bill Hader', 'Lewis Black']","['Pete Docter', 'Ronnie Del Carmen']"

With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.

What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. &quot;Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I&apos;ve never quite seen before. We&apos;re presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. 

The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character&apos;s motivations. It&apos;s obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it&apos;s constructed. 

One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they&apos;re in. That&apos;s not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. 

If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn&apos;t have changed anything about it. It&apos;s a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year.

He is one of a group of friends who live their lives day to day and hit to hit.  When he tries to kick the habit he manages it for a while but eventually falls back into his old way.  Meanwhile his friends are as messed up as he is, whether it be Spud&apos;s pathetic addiction, Begbie&apos;s violent rages or the fact that he is sleeping with a girl who still goes to school.

When it came out this film was very hyped, the poster became a must-have on every student&apos;s bedroom wall and the media went nuts over it&apos;s supposed glamorisation of drug use.  The plot is very difficult to summarise, as it doesn&apos;t really have a narrative flow other than the very disjointed experience of Renton.  However it manages to be very funny and imaginative all the way, using many different tricks and touches to be funny.  The dialogue is very well written and I must admit I found it a lot funnier than the last few comedies I watched.

The media may have condemned this film as promoting drug use, but I can only imagine that they watched a different film from me.  Sure, the film shows drugs as being fun and enjoyable but, like Renton says, `why else would we do it?&apos;  However the film clearly shows a massive downside where people&apos;s lives are destroyed, people OD and lives go day to day just trying to get high.  True, it does show this downside in a stylish and funny way but there is no question that the film is promoting drug use in any sense.

Too often I see films that are style over substance; Trainspotting gets it just perfect, stylish but not at the expense of dialogue, character or film. It is helped by a great cast.  McGregor jumped to stardom off the back of this role and he deserved it.  He keeps his character both likeable but repulsive at the same time and carries the film with surprising ease.  The support cast is excellent, even if they lack the same good character of Renton.  Whether it is the comic Bremner, the violent Carlyle or the tragic McKidd.  While not all their characters are well developed, they do all give good accounts of themselves, whether it is comic or showing the effects of heroin on their lives.

Overall this is a great film that is refreshing to see now without all the `cult student cool&apos; hype or media feeding frenzy over it&apos;s supposed pro-drug approach.

Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean&apos;s direction.

The jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.

Some of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the &apos;50s.

Leonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I&apos;ve seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy&apos;s selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fiancée and on down to the tiniest role. I&apos;m especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.

Spielberg&apos;s movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible.

First impressions of the film? Brilliant.

Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it&apos;s fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I&apos;m very pleased to say that he&apos;s pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.

The film (in case you&apos;re wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he&apos;s finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won&apos;t go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don&apos;t want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort&apos;s remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.

Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven&apos;t read the book this is your chance to find out.

What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they&apos;ve taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that&apos;s the same with all film adaptations! They&apos;ve got the main story down and where they&apos;ve deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.

Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It&apos;s full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it&apos;s like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!

This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.

Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I&apos;m going to say that it&apos;s not great, at times it&apos;s pretty good, but never great. For the most part it&apos;s okay. I&apos;m going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I&apos;m going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn&apos;t take away anything from the film, but it doesn&apos;t add much.

I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/,8.1,"['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Emma Watson', 'Rupert Grint']",['David Yates']

I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them, and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). Still, something felt off about &quot;Gran Torino&quot; based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be &apos;badass&apos; again, trying to be Dirty Harry again. &quot;Gran Torino&quot; is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry, and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry (it&apos;s a stretch), but he is a distinctive, memorable character on his own, and I&apos;d go as far as saying that it&apos;s one of Eastwood&apos;s finest performances, and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.

I&apos;m not going to argue that &quot;Gran Torino&quot; has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn&apos;t. In fact, some of them are downright bad at times, but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind (I am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous, something that isn&apos;t being captured well enough in advertising. It&apos;s absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense, fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood&apos;s tour-de-force direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.

Whether or not &quot;Gran Torino&quot; will hold up as one of Eastwood&apos;s great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all, you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet, but Eastwood&apos;s beautiful, nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which I won&apos;t discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it&apos;s really fun to watch this movie unfold, Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood&apos;s image. I don&apos;t mean that as a negative, it just adds to the film&apos;s strength as a character study.

It&apos;s a more intimate film than Eastwood&apos;s other film this year, &quot;Changeling&quot;, and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films, but it&apos;s just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around, it is a film about a man who, near the end of his life, is forced to confront his demons, and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it.

It&apos;s a film that tells an epic story in an epic way, filling every shot with artistry and colour until the screen overflows with splendour. Despite a lengthy running time, the pacing never flags. The episodic structure of the storyline works in the film&apos;s favour, ably chronicling the adventures of the titular character as he undergoes a thrilling journey to hell and back.

It has Charlton Heston playing his most famous role and being incredibly manly and heroic in it. It has a cast of seasoned performers in support, not least Jack Hawkins as the sympathetic Roman. It has Stephen Boyd as a truly nasty piece of work villain. It has the most spectacular and complex action sequence ever put on film in the shape of the chariot race, which is just as thrilling and breathtaking as it was when it was first released in cinemas back in the day.

And, finally, it&apos;s a film engages the senses and the emotions. It never forgets, amid all the glory and the epic wonder of the scenery and action, that this is a human story about real people struggling with their lives.

When he can&apos;t, he tries a new way to &quot;win&quot; a new pair.",1999-02-16,1H29M,"This translates to MUST-SEE! It&apos;s a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.

The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.

The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn&apos;t have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.

It&apos;s heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.

This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children&apos;s emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.

The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there&apos;s a serenity about it all.

I hope &quot;Children of Heaven&quot; will win this year&apos;s 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.

Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of  the Italian 1978&apos;s &quot;The Tree of the Wooden Clogs&quot; by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there&apos;s 1989&apos;s &quot;Bashu, The Little Stranger&quot;, by writer-director Bahram Beizai.

This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It&apos;s just beautiful.

For that, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too. In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It&apos;s no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring. Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you&apos;ll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.

Not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say &quot;underrated&quot; because this film, from what I&apos;ve read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That&apos;s too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, &quot;Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,&quot; played beautifully by Ryan O&apos;Neal. (For most of the movie, he&apos;s called &quot;Redmond Barry,&quot; so I will refer to him as that.) 

Overall, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a &quot;scoundrel&quot; back in late 18th century Englishman. &quot;Mr. Barry&quot; is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times. While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he&apos;s not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don&apos;t always know how he&apos;s going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.

We witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his &quot;sins begin to find him out,&quot; as the Bible would describe. It&apos;s quite a roller coaster ride.

This is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears. It&apos;s quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick. I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day.

The story begins with him living with wife and children in upstate New York as a free man. After being lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work, he was subsequently drugged, chained, beaten, stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who treated him in contrasting ways. The first was relatively civilized by slave-owner standards, but the plantation&apos;s half-wit manager was threatened by Northup&apos;s superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment, Northup&apos;s owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This individual regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit, which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.

It&apos;s noteworthy that a British director has chosen to tell this story, and the combination of John Ridley&apos;s script and McQueen&apos;s direction has inspired fine performances from the entire cast. Their dramatization of Northup&apos;s experiences is both riveting and uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a society that permitted such barbarism. Hopefully a large US audience will learn how a Southern elite cruelly exploited their fellow humans in order to obtain an easier life for themselves.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/,8.1,"['Chiwetel Ejiofor', 'Michael Kenneth Williams', 'Michael Fassbender']",['Steve McQueen']

Unfortunately, both know that this will probably be their only night together.",2005-02-11,1H41M,"Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater&apos;s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it&apos;s glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that&apos;s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental &apos;Hollywood romance&apos;, which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...

Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it&apos;s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they&apos;re the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they&apos;re watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it&apos;s own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I&apos;m not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don&apos;t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.

In a film like this, it is the writing that&apos;s the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that&apos;s the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn&apos;t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.

Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/,8.1,"['Ethan Hawke', 'Julie Delpy', 'Andrea Eckert']",['Richard Linklater']

Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.

Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.

In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris&apos;s acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, &quot;why in the world would the characters do that?!&quot; But here&apos;s what&apos;s interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.

I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth&apos;s marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard&apos;s life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.

Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.

Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford&apos;s delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience&apos;s hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn&apos;t even really know what he&apos;s found. Things don&apos;t magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it&apos;s a movie it&apos;s a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard&apos;s briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel&apos;s scenes in Deckard&apos;s apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.

Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  &quot;If only you could see what I&apos;ve seen with your eyes,&quot; he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.

As for which cut of the film, I don&apos;t think any single one is perfect (and I&apos;d honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the &quot;Final Cut&quot; over the others and admire Ridley Scott&apos;s restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won&apos;t even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy&apos;s beckoning of Sebastian could&apos;ve been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don&apos;t have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it&apos;s still a beautiful film to just  watch.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/,8.1,"['Harrison Ford', 'Rutger Hauer', 'Sean Young']",['Ridley Scott']

While it isn&apos;t quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don&apos;t like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast&apos;s roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson&apos;s style), &apos;The Grand Budapest Hotel&apos; is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.

It really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.

Alexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it&apos;s never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.

&apos;The Grand Budapest Hotel&apos; boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.

Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.

In conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one&apos;s taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/,8.1,"['Ralph Fiennes', 'F. Murray Abraham', 'Mathieu Amalric']",['Wes Anderson']

When I first saw this in the theater I felt disappointed and baited and switched. Robin Williams may be top billed, but he is not the center of the film although he is the motivating character. He is a new teacher at an elite private school for boys that has traditions that probably nobody remembers the reasons for. Williams&apos; character is out of step with the rest of the faculty at the school and encourages his students to seize the day. Anyone who grew up with the overbearing-we-expect-more-out-of-you parents, or even attended boarding school, or grew up in some similar environment can identify with the students in the film.

Every aspect of this film is powerful. From screenplay to direction, casting to acting, the movie drags us into a world of teenagers that are REAL. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes rebellious ... sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. This is very much a Peter Weir film. The screenplay is one the most powerful ones ever, and one characteristic of this movie is the evolution the characters go through. Just like Truman Show, Witness, The Last Wave and Fearless, Weir drags his characters into the story and changes them. He evolves them so that, in the end, his characters are more human and feel something beyond traditional beliefs and codes; Things that people have died for throughout history: Freedom, Respect, Pride... things that may not be that important to an average person, things that make one a hero.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/,8.1,"['Robin Williams', 'Robert Sean Leonard', 'Ethan Hawke']",['Peter Weir']

442,Gone Girl (2014) - IMDb,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MDQ3MzAzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU1NzE3MjE@._V1_.jpg,The husband of a missing woman becomes the chief suspect in her disappearance.,2017-08-01,2H29M,"Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he&apos;s trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?

&quot;Gone Girl&quot;, based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. &quot;Gone Girl&quot; is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: &quot;This case is about what people think of you.&quot;

Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It&apos;s the point where &quot;Gone Girl&quot; becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn&apos;t a thriller anymore, it&apos;s a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it, and I can&apos;t praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. 

Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You&apos;ll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick&apos;s caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She&apos;s the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.

&quot;Gone Girl&quot; might be Fincher&apos;s most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that&apos;s not awesome, I don&apos;t know what is.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998/,8.1,"['Ben Affleck', 'Rosamund Pike', 'Neil Patrick Harris']",['David Fincher']

In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar&apos;s best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK&apos;s success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn&apos;t been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.

Actually, RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar&apos;s best film, though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES. The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative--I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film (something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II). Plus, after years of making CG movies, the look is taken to a whole new level in this film--it just looks breathtaking.

Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid&apos;s movie as its predecessors. Sure, it can be enjoyed by the kids, but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept (illegitimate birth) and includes a swear word (though not one the really &quot;bad&quot; ones, you can be sure). Also, while the rats are kind of cute (and a marketer&apos;s dream), most of the rest of the story isn&apos;t and there are no catchy kid&apos;s tunes. No, instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities--something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC. to be seen (incorrectly) as &quot;just a kid&apos;s movie&quot;.

Amazing animation, excellent writing and, the rarest of rare, a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered.

It isn&apos;t bad since Chaplin himself redid it, but I just prefer the original.

It isn&apos;t as funny as The Kid, not as heartbreaking as City Lights, and it doesn&apos;t have the social commentary of Modern Times. Instead it has a little bit of everything plus lots of atmosphere AND it takes Chaplin&apos;s Little Tramp out of some anonymous urban environment and lands him in a very specific place and time - the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s. I could feel the biting cold, the hunger, the loneliness. And in spite of this being set in the 1890s and seeming quite authentic to its setting, this film has a very modern feel to it, almost timeless.

Chaplin&apos;s &quot;little fellow&quot; is introduced as a lone prospector. We never see him doing any prospecting, but it is later mentioned that he is not very successful at it and gives it up. The first part of the film has the little fellow waiting out a blizzard in a cabin with a wanted criminal in addition to a fellow prospector. The second part has Chaplin&apos;s character traveling to a Klondike boom town, watching a cabin for a more successful prospector, and falling in love with a dance hall girl who thinks his crush is just a big joke, at least at first.

I don&apos;t think it was Chaplin&apos;s best silent film, but it does manage to do all aspects of the production very well and I can see why some people would judge it as his best. And if that was Chaplin in that chicken suit, all I can say is that he had the motions of a chicken down pat.

Still, having previously heard over and over again about the brilliance of this film, I never really understood until I saw it myself. It&apos;s not just the dream-story and the surreality, it&apos;s what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.

Thus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it&apos;s FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There&apos;s no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of &quot;Pretentious!&quot;, but still people can say &quot;It&apos;s amazing.&quot; There&apos;s no comedic conceit that says, &quot;Bah, just simple slapstick, it&apos;s low-culture!&quot; because it&apos;s rather intelligently done. And it&apos;s creative in a way that isn&apos;t like an opium-dream. It can appeal to anybody of all ages. It&apos;s one very well-done film.

His Heaven&apos;s Gate was the disaster that ended the Hollywood auteur era of the 60s and 70s. And one needs look no further than the first act of The Deer Hunter to see why. Maybe Cimino thought he really needed three one-hour acts for some sort of symmetry. I don&apos;t know. What I do know is that act one was about twice as long as it had any business being. It dragged. Painfully so.

Now, once we leave Clairton for Vietnam, the film elevates to brilliance. Acts two and three are masterful. Cimino&apos;s work here is glorious. And the acting is splendid from the first scene onward. DeNiro and Walken get most of the cred, but Streep and Cazale are both monumental here. Savage and Dzundza also turn in splendid performances. Dzundza&apos;s is the easiest to overlook, just as Savage&apos;s is the easiest to discount. But his work is needed for the whole tragic tale to hang together.

In a steamy, impoverished Latin American town called Las Piedras, insects grope clumsily in the dust, struggling to escape the strings that children have tied to them. People from all over the world congregate in the streets and bars and the air is thick with choking dust. Clouzot makes clear the desperation of the residents, &quot;It&apos;s like prison,&quot; explains one of them. &quot;Easy to get in, but escape is impossible.&quot; The Southern Oil Company (SOC - same initials as Standard Oil) runs the town and enjoys its profits while the villagers are compelled to work odd jobs just to stay alive. After a fire breaks out at one of the oil fields killing many workers, the anti-union American boss seeks experienced drivers from among the townspeople to put out the fire. It is here that the anti-American flavor runs thick and where much of this part of the film was originally excised for American audiences (but has since been restored). 

Four men, desperate to escape their trap, agree to drive a truck loaded with nitroglycerine 300 miles over treacherous mountain roads in the hot sun for the sum of $2000 each. Transporting the nitroglycerine for them is a way out of hopelessness -- either through a big paycheck or through sudden death, with the latter appearing the more probable. Though sadly past the point in time when we can still be shocked over gangster capitalism and men selling out for money, the story is nonetheless compelling. The four who are chosen to go on this fool&apos;s errand include Mario, a young Corsican played by Yves Montand in a role that brought him widespread attention. He is carrying on an affair with a local servant girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot) who is in love with him. His treatment of her, however, is atrocious and reflects the attitude of the male-dominated society they live in. Also picked to drive one of the trucks is Jo, an aging Parisian small-time crook (Charles Vanel), Luigi (Folco Lulli), an Italian with less than a year to live, and an ex-nazi pilot (Peter van Eyck). This unlikely group will play a cat-and-mouse game with death for the remainder of the film.

Clouzot depicts several incidents that bring the tension to the boiling point. In the first one, the trucks must travel at least 40 mph over a pot-holed stretch of road to prevent the vibrations from setting off the nitroglycerine. The second involves a sharp, narrow turn that requires the trucks to back up onto an unstable, rotten wooden platform causing it to buckle. Almost immediately afterwards, the trucks are stopped by a huge boulder in the middle of the road and must siphon off some of the nitroglycerine to blow it up. Finally, Mario must deftly maneuver the truck over a depression of spilled oil with the wheels stuck in reverse. As the long treacherous journey unfolds, roles are reversed between Mario and Jo as Mario becomes the strong dominant one and Jo, in Charles Vanel&apos;s brilliant performance, becomes shaken, fearful, and docile. Their relationship becomes the highlight of the film as the two become mutually dependent on each other for survival and comfort. 

I found Wages of Fear to be an involving experience that kept me riveted throughout, though I did sense that there would not be a two and a half-hour film unless somebody survived. Although the unexpected plot twists were gripping, the best part of the film for me was the revelation of each character when faced with fear. It reminded me of the &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, a film that also showed men discovering the truth about themselves and others while pursuing their dream of wealth. Wages of Fear lived up to its accolades, but for me the discordant ending clashed both with the tone of the film and with my experience of the universe not as arbitrary or capricious but as filled with meaning and purpose.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046268/,8.1,"['Yves Montand', 'Charles Vanel', 'Peter van Eyck']",['Henri-Georges Clouzot']

On the Waterfront is widely known to be an act of expiation on the part of Elia Kazan for naming names to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) during the Joseph McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s.

This trend-setting film has a gritty portrait of N. Y. waterfront and stand up well nowadays and resulted to be a huge financial hit , it is a winner all the way , as from a budget of just under $1 million, the film went on to gross ten times its production costs in its initial release.

One needn&apos;t know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naïve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children&apos;s camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor&apos;s political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.

This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra&apos;s films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  

I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren&apos;t realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. 

Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don&apos;t compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.

Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith&apos;s noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.

This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

It was the first Bergman&apos;s film I ever saw. This picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is one of Bergman&apos;s most optimistic, profound, and warm films.

&quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life&apos;s disappointment, regrets, and losses. The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.

Sparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman&apos;s regulars  Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; which also include Bergman&apos;s writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050986/,8.1,"['Victor Sjöström', 'Bibi Andersson', 'Ingrid Thulin']",['Ingmar Bergman']

It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score.  &quot;The Third Man&quot; is remembered for many things - for Orson Welles&apos; wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises.  Adding to these is Joseph Cotten&apos;s fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together - it is his character who initiates most of the action, and also through whom we view everything and everyone else.

The story starts, after a nicely done prologue, with Martins arriving in Vienna, and finding out that his friend Harry is not only dead but is accused of running a particularly destructive black market racket.  Martins sets out at once to prove his friend&apos;s innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend - but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better.  It is just right that Martins is an innocent who writes cheap novels for a living, and he gets a pretty memorable lesson in fiction vs. reality.  There are some great scenes (the Ferris-wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins.  The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.

The scene with Larry and the car is probably my favourite from the whole movie, talk about hilarious, that poor car.

Jeff Bridges has put in some marvellous performances over the years, for me though, this is the best, he just nails it, he&apos;s hilarious.

John Goodman is great, he steals many of the scenes, Julianne Moore is terrific, not sure if I prefer the accent or hairstyle, she&apos;s so good.

It&apos;s that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity.

Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don&apos;t live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can&apos;t protect themselves.

A knight and his squire have returned to their country after a ten-year crusade. Deadly disease ravaged country. Knight faces Death. He calls Death on the multi-day game of chess...

The story has touched serious philosophical and religious topics. However, the story is full of intrigue, dark humor and hope. The protagonists are distracted between the vicious disease, self-pity and torture. It is interesting to see a deeply disillusioned knight, a cynical squire who hates women, a cheating wife, evil priests, a mute girl and seemingly healthy and happy family on the same road. The truth is all around them. The main protagonist used to persistently ask questions to which only he has a valid response. This film reveals some controversial issues. Is deadly disease greater threat to man or the man is the greatest enemy to himself? Mr. Bergman has painted realistic effects of fear, horror, cynicism, surprises, love and health on human faces.

Max von Sydow as Antonius Block, the knight is a more serious version of Don Quixote. Gunnar Björnstrand Jöns, the squire is a character who never changes his mood. He always has some sort of cynical jokes or words of contempt for each occurrence. Bengt Ekerot is Death in the true sense of that word. Nils Poppe as Jof is a juggler who has strange predictions. Fortunately, no one believes him. Bibi Andersson as Mia, Jof&apos;s wife is a beautiful and cheerful woman who does not fit into the landscape.

With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980&apos;s.

In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man&apos;s future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who&apos;s unborn son will become mankind&apos;s only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?

Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger&apos;s most popular role. I cannot see why it isn&apos;t. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.

Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante&apos;s Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor&apos;s protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease. 

The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film. 

There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood&apos;s most famous lines in it, that of Arnie&apos;s &apos;I&apos;ll be back&apos;, a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.

So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too &apos;eightish&apos;, and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it, I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent, but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come, a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of &apos;I&apos;ll be back&apos;!

Not having read the book or really heard anything specific about the film, it did catch me off guard in a small way, since I had come into the film with the specifics of the situation in mind. The first half of the film does make it more than this though, because I was drawn into a relationship which was emotionally raw and compelling. The film uses the limits of the room really well, focusing on the mother/son relationship and making us care about it while also being horrified by the specifics.

The second half of the film manages to maintain that engagement, while flipping the characters in such a way that made the drama work in a much different way, and cast a different light on the first half of the film. It is tough in terms of subject matter, but at the same time it is easy to watch because of how well the film draws you into caring about the lead two characters.

The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.

Johnny Depp&apos;s performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener&apos;s daughter, Elizabeth Swan.

How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn&apos;t intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.

A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.

The Rwandan genocide - that&apos;s what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.

Terry George&apos;s film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.

Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; (1993). But whereas Spielberg&apos;s masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don&apos;t mean that pejoratively - George&apos;s film seems more immediate. Maybe it&apos;s because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren&apos;t doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; a sense of urgency.

As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There&apos;s brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment&apos;s made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.

Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.

Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn&apos;t a false note in his performance. For years, he&apos;s turned in one superb performance after another. He&apos;s one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren&apos;t all that memorable. Here, he&apos;s in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul&apos;s frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.

He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul&apos;s Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That&apos;s why the moment&apos;s shattering.

&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; isn&apos;t flawless. George doesn&apos;t harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film&apos;s end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film&apos;s straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.

I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we&apos;re doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq&apos;s supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.

I can only hope the success of &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395169/,8.1,"['Don Cheadle', 'Sophie Okonedo', 'Joaquin Phoenix']",['Terry George']

The first thing that stands out about the film is the cinematography. It&apos;s rare that a film like this is considered both genuine and a good example of it&apos;s art but La Haine is both.

The plotline is compelling and realistic and neatly shows the way that inner city life has gone in the big cities in France as well as proving that despite the romance of Paris, it suffers from the same problems as any other major city.

The characters are above all believable and the cast did a great job. The quality of acting is simply stunning from several actors and it would be a shame if it was simply dismissed as &quot;just another foreign art-house movie&quot; by audiences outside France.

Above all the film whilst showing the influences of American films and society has a very clear sense of it&apos;s own identity and at no time does it feel like another US Ghetto film transposed to France. This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this. It is, however, their loss.

A shrewd examination of the brutality of war and the duality of man in conflict.",2004-05-08,2H,"Platoon is generally regarded as one of the strongest anti-war films of all time. While this is certainly true, what&apos;s often overlooked -- at least after only one run through the film -- is that it&apos;s chiefly a tale of God vs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt, Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.

The story is told from the point of view of Chris Taylor (solidly played by Charlie Sheen), a middle class kid who goes to Vietnam to do what he thinks is his patriotic duty. In the first ten minutes, Chris is shown in the uncomfortable jungle, struggling just to survive in the natural environment, let alone do any actual damage to the enemy. Quickly we&apos;re introduced to the well-known facets of the Vietnam War: The lack of sense of purpose, the wraith-like enemies, the obvious prevalence of the uneducated and poor among the fighting grunts -- and, soon, we see how these factors combine to cause widespread low morale and some actions of more than questionable ethical value.

Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). These two really are the driving force behind the film. They both have nominally the same enemy (the Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn&apos;t take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the &quot;enemy&quot; does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all -- it&apos;s an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). I won&apos;t deny it is a very black-vesus-white relationship, but this polarity does not feel contrived. Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really -- as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself -- they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.

Elias/Barnes&apos; hold on the platoon, and the viewer, is developed through several war sequences. A chilling scene takes place in a village, where our soldiers find no VC, but they do find a cache of VC weapons. The inhumanity of certain soldiers, including of Sgt. Barnes, is unflinchingly shown here. It leaves the viewer with an empty feeling that is hard to shake, reminding of the similarly empty look on a woman&apos;s face after she sees her son killed in front her.

Elias doesn&apos;t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.

Don&apos;t watch this movie for the action. That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s not well shot, or unrealistic. On the contrary. It&apos;s quite convincing. But it doesn&apos;t show war as a fun sport, and it&apos;s never a question of good guys versus bad guys. There will be no cheering for the &quot;good guys&quot; or anyone else in this one. Stone succeeds brilliantly at putting the viewer into the middle of it all, and it&apos;s not a pretty sigh (and definitely not for the squeamish, either).

On the other hand, if you want great acting, it&apos;s here. Dafoe and Berenger do incredibly well, with the incredibly good (and seemingly authentically sounding) script. Barnes is horrific as he challenges three men to kill him, drinking hard liquor out of the bottle. They don&apos;t make a move, and neither will you, though you&apos;ll hate him just as much as them. Dafoe is a ray of light in the dark as Elias. The cast is rounded out with many characters, all well played, and adding another dimension to the film.

The technical aspects of the film are superb, though one never thinks about them much, as the movie is completely engrossing. The production values seem quite good, as well. The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film, however, is the music. It&apos;s emotional and draining, and used to great effect -- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.

Watch this one a few times, and you&apos;ll likely be quite moved each time. I&apos;ll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 9/10",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091763/,8.1,"['Charlie Sheen', 'Tom Berenger', 'Willem Dafoe']",['Oliver Stone']

This is a fantastic film. It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked &apos;Before Sunrise&apos; as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says &quot;nothing that is complete breathes&quot;, and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.

The dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end.

He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film.

While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.

There&apos;s no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the &apos;Oz&apos; characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy&apos;s friends want?

The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today&apos;s computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.

However, it is their enmity that pushes them to their limits.",2013-09-15,2H3M,"The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. 

The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian &quot;professor&quot; Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. 

The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. 

The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. 

The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I&apos;m not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. 

After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail – although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then – and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). 

We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here – the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. 

The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame – only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt – Lord Hesketh, &quot;Bubbles&quot; Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. 

The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt&apos;s first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame – as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. 

The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film &quot;feels&quot; like it&apos;s happening in the 70&apos;s.

Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters.  So why is it one of my favorite musicals?  OK, go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure.  I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&apos;s immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much.  I seem to play it a lot around tax time.

And I&apos;m not alone.  Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time?  Well, first of all they spared no expense.  The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery.  From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I&apos;m being swept away to another world.  I&apos;m not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway.  The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R &amp; H extravaganza &quot;South Pacific.&quot;)  That in itself is an incredible feat.

Now about those songs.  Almost every one of them is absolute drivel.  So what makes them work?  Easy.  The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by  extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score.  It&apos;s hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things.  Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in.  Or the Mother Superior&apos;s soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere.  Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss.  Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed.  Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo.  The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don&apos;t transcend the script (which they didn&apos;t prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.

The script is undeniably trite and probably the film&apos;s weakest link.  But again, the characters play it straight all the way.  Not one actor looks embarrassed.  Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect. 

And as for the characters.  Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material.  I certainly can&apos;t.  Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead!  After all, Andrews did lose out on &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; the year before.  But now  certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role.  Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute.  She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly.  Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun.  I can&apos;t think of anyone more suitable for this role either.  As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing,  creating their own individual personalities by film&apos;s end.

Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief.  Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor.  The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria&apos;s chief romantic rival, getting some of the film&apos;s best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement.  Parker developed a devout cult following after this role.  Peggy Wood&apos;s Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.

For those who tear &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that.  But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking &quot;Peter Pan&quot; for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home.  It&apos;s ludicrous.  Despite the fact that it&apos;s based on a true story, we&apos;re not watching &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; for stark realism.  Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending.  Nothing more.  If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent &quot;Holocaust&quot; or &quot;Schindler&apos;s List.&quot; Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world!  Period.

I suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot;  If this movie was made today I&apos;m afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters.

All that existed, apart from newspapers and radio, were three or four &quot;broadcast&quot; television channels. Since then, technology has exploded with a cornucopia of communication devices. Which renders the story in &quot;Network&quot; painfully dated. And yet ...

The story&apos;s theme is as valid now as it was thirty-three years ago. The theme is that the ratings business has corrupted television, because ad revenue, and therefore profit, is tied to the ratings. Programs and events then, and now, get aired if, and only if, they are likely to result in high ratings. It&apos;s all very seamy, very dishonorable, very shabby, and very relevant to today&apos;s world of ten thousand channels.

Though most of the characters in &quot;Network&quot; end up being corrupted by television, Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is one who does not. His vision is pure. And he speaks the truth: &quot;... television is an ... amusement park ... a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of ... story tellers ... jugglers, sideshow freaks ... and football players ... You&apos;re never going to get any truth from us (television) ... We lie like hell ... We deal in illusions, none of it is true. But you people ... believe the illusions ... You do whatever the tube tells you ... you even think like the tube&quot;. Worse yet, people elect their leaders based on how they look and sound, and how their words are interpreted by boob tube &quot;pundits&quot;.

&quot;Network&quot; is a film wherein thematic import is conveyed almost entirely through dialogue. Some of the dialogue devolves into speechifying, which may come across to viewers as preachy. Still, the film&apos;s message was highly prophetic. Except for the film&apos;s climax, everything predicted in this film has already happened. And credit should go to script writer Paddy Chayefsky for his futuristic vision.

Some parts of the film seem superfluous in retrospect, like the romance between two main characters. But the film has a sense of realism, helped along by the use of technical jargon and a general absence of background music. The film&apos;s technical elements, including direction, casting, acting, editing, and cinematography, are fine.

As social commentary, &quot;Network&quot; is one of the best films ever made, despite a dated, time-bound, story. That &quot;there are no nations, only currency&quot; is becoming increasingly obvious, and as Ned Beatty&apos;s arrogant character explains in a frighteningly ominous tone: &quot;The world is a business, Mr. Beale&quot;.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/,8.1,"['Faye Dunaway', 'William Holden', 'Peter Finch']",['Sidney Lumet']

I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.

Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.

The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.

Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.

Very few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.

While providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis&apos; inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.

Aside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack&apos;s character, who is (through no fault of Stack&apos;s) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up, the members of Benny&apos;s acting troupe get some fine moments of their own, Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters, and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035446/,8.1,"['Carole Lombard', 'Jack Benny', 'Robert Stack']",['Ernst Lubitsch']

Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He&apos;s a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he&apos;s intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn&apos;t value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) &quot;Some people feel like they don&apos;t deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,&quot; and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.

I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn&apos;t feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man &quot;when you forgive, you love.&quot; We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that &quot;happiness (is) only real when shared&quot;, which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.

I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: &quot;There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...&quot;

And at the end as I thought about McCandless&apos;s life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: &quot;Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.

Egged on by his school mates, Shoya bullies the newly arrived Shoko, who happens to be deaf. Perceived to be receiving special treatment, and being different (a crime in Japanese society), Shoko is fair game for any number of cruelties. Until it goes too far.

This movie then takes a different approach. Instead of showing the bullied person&apos;s return to strength, it shows the traumatised bully (and his cohorts) as he seeks to recover from the horror he put Shoko through. You may balk at the thought, but the paths of Shoya and Shoko are explored in their later high school lives, both being treated sympathetically.

He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles.  Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.

El Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called &apos;The Goat&apos;, who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function.  With intricate structure, &apos;Amores perros&apos; tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls &apos;illegal economies&apos; (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can&apos;t depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world&apos;s mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments.  Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.

These two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his &apos;job&apos;, wiping out businessman.  If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left,  happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.

There is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the &apos;Cain and Abel&apos; half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia&apos;s functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.

Except for the director.  Like Paul Thomas Anderson in &apos;Magnolia&apos;, although to a less self-conscious degree, Gonzales Inarritu is the God of his film, intricately creating the structure that links his characters and their different environments.  These are negative connections, however, which work against the idea of coherent meaning in life - contact usually results in destruction (physical, material, spiritual), or diminishing.

He is also an Old Testament god, punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success - the gains of capitalism are prey to the violent whims of chance: Gonzalez Inarritu doesn&apos;t need frogs to shake a rigid society or mindset.

Moral change is linked to physical change - being beaten up, losing a leg, cutting hair.  The punning title, with its reference to the dog-eat/fight-dog nature of modern life, and its general unsatisfactoriness, also gives the film its Biblical feel, the idea of Mexico as an asphalt desert, or a rubbish heap, with all these scrawny mutts scavenging the remains.

&apos;Amores perros&apos; shares  the sickly, bleached near-monochrome look of many recent crime films, like &apos;Chopper&apos; or &apos;Bleeder&apos;.  But where the heightened mise-en-scene in those works were expressionistic projections of their protagonists&apos; psychosis, here it&apos;s part of a controlling world-view, the universal consciousness that creates, connects and destroys.

 The three stories, though connected narratively and symbolically, are mutually distinct - the first is an exhilirating mix of violent gangster film and frustrated romance; the second is like a short story (the screenwriter is a novelist), a figurative plot where movement is through image, symbol and idea, rather than film narrative; the third is a kind of spiritual journey, with an appropriately Biblical (or Wim Wenders-like) openness.

&apos;Amores perros&apos; is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim - it says more about contemporary cinema that a film only has to hold your interest for it to be a masterpiece - but it is consistently enthralling, and, despite all the stylistic tics and brutal violence, bracingly humanist.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712/,8.0,"['Emilio Echevarría', 'Gael García Bernal', 'Goya Toledo']",['Alejandro G.

One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I&apos;m not much of an Olivier fan but he&apos;s superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter&apos;s new bride. I can&apos;t spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can&apos;t imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in &apos;Suspicion&apos; with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but &apos;Rebecca&apos; is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson (&apos;Laura&apos;) as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca&apos;s slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter&apos;s bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy.

I can think of few films with a simpler premise and plot line - it really is only about an anonymous man in prison attempting to escape. That&apos;s it. Yet, director Robert Bresson, more than any other director I can think of (with the exception of Yasujiro Ozu), can imbue the drab everyday details of life with life-and-death importance.

His style of film-making is completely unobtrusive and restrained, because he has figured out a simple truth that about 95% of all film directors never realize: the less a director tries to &quot;push&quot; his ideas through a film, ironically, the greater the range of ideas he is able to elicit in his audience. You bring to this movie whatever life experience and ideas you carry with you; an older child as well as an aging philosophy professor can enjoy this film equally, and for very different reasons. In addition, I believe this is also the most realistic film that I have ever seen. It takes the skill of a master to make reality into great cinema, and this film is one of Bresson&apos;s greatest. It could even be his greatest, because though his other films &quot;Au Hasard Balthazar&quot; and &quot;Pickpocket&quot; are great masterpieces, they can never have the same kind of accessibility to virtually any living person in the world as this has.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/,8.2,"['François Leterrier', 'Charles Le Clainche', 'Maurice Beerblock']",['Robert Bresson']
